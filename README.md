# Hot or Not Tub

Have you looked for a hotel or other lodging for travel, purely filtered on whether or not they have a hot tub, book based on that prefence - only to find out their hot tub is out of order, cold, or otherwise lacking? That's a *NOT TUB*. If only there was an additional way to find reviews or ratings that tell you whether an establishment's "hot tub" is truly a hot tub, or a not tub.
